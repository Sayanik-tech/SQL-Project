## forecast accuracy
## Business Problem 1: I need an aggregate forecast accuracy report for all the customers for a given fiscal year.
##                   so that I can track the accuracy of the forecast we make for the customers
## Columns: Customer_code,Name,Market,Total sold Quantity,Total forecast quantity,
##	        Net error,Absolute error,Forecast accuract %

## Business problem 2: The supply chain business manager wants to see which customersâ€™ forecast accuracy has dropped from 2020 to 2021. 
 ##   Provide a complete report with these columns: customer_code, customer_name, market, forecast_accuracy_2020, forecast_accuracy_2021
